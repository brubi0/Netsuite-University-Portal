Course wrap up. During this Advanced Workflows course, you applied the foundational knowledge, skills, and best practices learned throughout this course to build several business process workflows using many of the advanced capabilities of SuiteFlow.

Through the completion of several hands-on exercises, you built several modular workflows supporting the following advanced workflow functions-- configuring Service-level Agreements using scheduled actions and transitions, executing actions and transitions using saved searches as conditions, configuring multiple business processes that run in parallel using sub-workflows, altering the state of a workflow based on changes to related records, using SQL and SuiteScript formulas in conditions, integrating custom workflow actions created using Workflow Action Scripts, and executing workflows in different processing contexts, such as CSV Import, User Event Script, and Suitelet.
