Welcome to SuiteFlow, Advanced Workflows. In this module, we will discuss the following topics. We will begin by reviewing the types of NetSuite roles that will benefit the most from this course. We will identify any prerequisite knowledge that you should have to ensure you get the most out of this course. Then we will review the primary goals and objectives of the course and provide you with information about your training account and student workbook that will be useful when completing the hands-on exercises in each course module.

Designed for the experienced technical NetSuite user, this course introduces many of SuiteFlow's more advanced capabilities supporting more complex use cases such as scheduling workflows, actions, and transitions, incorporating sub-workflows to support sequential workflow processing and parallel approvals, using saved searches in action and transition conditions, altering workflow processing based on changes to related record data, and extending the power of SuiteFlow using formulas and SuiteScript. You will apply the knowledge and skills learned throughout this course by completing several hands-on exercises that will guide you through the creation of several full-featured business processes utilizing modular workflow development principles and SuiteFlow best practices.

The target audience for this course includes software developers, consultants, system administrators, and other technical users of NetSuite and experienced SuiteFlow users who want to support more complex business processes. Participants should have an aptitude for completing the following tasks. Navigating the NetSuite interface and completing basic administrative tasks, building saved search criteria using expressions, and an aptitude for creating workflows supporting basic approval processing.

A basic understanding of the following concepts will also be beneficial. Event-based software development principles and an understanding of if-then logic, processing loops, and other programming constructs. Please note that although this course does not require participants to write extensive code, it is considered an advanced level SuiteFlow course. As such, participants should possess the required knowledge above.

The primary goal of this course is to provide you with an applied understanding of the key terminologies, concepts, skills, and best practices that will enable you to support more complex business processes using many of the advanced capabilities of SuiteFlow. Upon the completion of this course, you will be able to use the workflow scheduler to schedule action and transition execution to support basic service-level agreements, conditionally execute actions and transitions using saved searches, configure business processes that run sequentially and in parallel using sub-workflows initiated with the initiate workflow action, configure transition execution based on changes to data stored in joint records, create SQL and SuiteScript formulas for use in action and transition conditions, integrate custom workflow actions using workflow action scripts, execute workflows in different processing contexts such as CSV Import, User Event Script, and Suitelet, and list each of the workflow mass updates and when you would run each type, and develop workflows based on best practices to ensure optimal workflow performance.

If you registered for the training on-demand version of this course, you were not provided with your training account login information in the registration and welcome email sent to you when you registered for the course. When you are ready to start the course, you must request the provisioning of your course training account by contacting NetSuite Training. The welcome email includes a link to download the student workbook, which includes all the hands-on course exercises.

Your student workbook contains all the hands-on exercises for this course. These exercises are designed to reinforce the knowledge and skills learned in each module. While most exercises have been designed to guide you through the completion of specific tasks in a very prescriptive step-by-step manner, you may find some exercises challenging at times, depending on your experience level with NetSuite.

The following guidelines will help as you work through the hands-on exercises in this course. Follow the exercise steps closely, but feel free to go beyond the exercise steps. If problems are encountered in a particular exercise, consider it an unexpected but invaluable learning opportunity. Troubleshooting and ultimately resolving issues on your own using the resources provided to you during this course will teach you more than any training guide can. You are encouraged to complete all required exercises in each module, as there may be dependencies on these exercises in future modules.

In the event that you get stuck on an exercise, solution workflows have been preloaded into each NetSuite training account and can be viewed by navigating to Customization, Workflow, Workflows, and filtering the list of workflows by Furniture Request SOLUTION. Please note that most solution workflows will need to be enabled prior to execution. Finally, optional exercises may be completed after each module's required exercises.

As we work through each module in this course, I will be performing walkthrough demonstrations that highlight many of the features and capabilities of SuiteFlow. In this first walkthrough, we will demonstrate how to log in to your NetSuite training account, review the online resources available in the NetSuite Help Center, and establish a few key user preferences that will be important when working with SuiteFlow.

To log in to your NetSuite training account, the first thing you're going to need to do is to navigate to NetSuite.com. And here I am in Google Chrome browser, and all I'm going to do is come up here into the address bar and simply enter NetSuite.com, and it takes me to the public-facing homepage. And you can see, in the upper right corner, I do have a Log In button that I can click on, which will allow me to go ahead and log in to our training account. Now, it just so happens that I have my username and password information stored as part of a bookmark, so I'm just going to go ahead and use that right here, as you can see. I've entered my username and my password, and I'm going to click Log In.

Now, when you go ahead and log in to your NetSuite training account, you're going to go ahead and use the username and password provided to you in the welcome email sent to you when you registered for this course. Please do not change the email address or password associated with your training account log in. When logging in for the first time, you may be prompted to enter security questions. Please follow the instructions provided to you in your student workbook when entering your answers. I am not being prompted because I have previously logged in to this training account and have already set the security questions accordingly.

Upon successful login to your training account, you will be taken to the Home dashboard. You can get back to this Home dashboard at any time by clicking on the Home icon in the NetSuite navigation bar. You will also notice that we are currently logged in to our training account as Larry Nelson, Administrator. This user will be used to complete most workflow development tasks throughout this course.

It's important to remember that you cannot be logged in to multiple NetSuite accounts using a single browser. For example, if you want to log in to your company's NetSuite production or sandbox account at the same time you are logged in to your course training account, you must use different browsers. Now, what I'd like to do is point out the online resources available for SuiteFlow, and the first thing that I'm going to do is just take you to the NetSuite Help Center by clicking on the Help link at the top of the NetSuite homepage.

Here, you can see we have all the product documentation for NetSuite, and right over here, under SuiteCloud Platform, you will see that there is a node for SuiteFlow, Workflows. And clicking on that will provide you with access to all of the product documentation as well as various references and workflow examples that you can refer to. Clicking on the SuiteAnswers link from the NetSuite Help Center takes you to an invaluable resource that provides you with access to links to NetSuite training resources, which could be seen right over here, as well as NetSuite support articles, demo videos, links to Help Center documentation, recorded new feature preview presentations, and even SuiteWorld presentations. Definitely get to know SuiteAnswers. Lots of great information out here.

Now what I'd like to do is establish a few key user preferences that will be useful as we work through this course. And to do that, I'm going to come over here to my Home icon, and I'm going to choose Set Preferences. There's only a few that we really need in this particular course, and the first one is going to be right over here on the General sub-tab, and it's going to be the time zone.

Notice that the default is Pacific Time in the US and Canada. I'm going to go ahead and change that to my particular time zone, which just so happens to be Mountain Time. And this will be important when we discuss the workflow scheduler as well as when we're viewing date and time stamps associated with workflow logging events.

The next setting that I want to set is going to be my date format, and in this case, I'm going to leave it at the default of month, day, and year. The format selected here directly affects how conditions are defined when referencing date and time fields in the condition builder. And finally, up here at the top under the Default section, there's an option called Show Internal IDs. I'm going to go ahead and enable that. Enabling this option displays field IDs when viewing field-level help in NetSuite. It also is required to see workflow IDs in the workflow execution log when troubleshooting workflow execution.

Now that I've got those user preferences set, I'm just going to go ahead and save those. And we are now ready to continue with this course. Please note that many of the walkthrough demonstrations presented in this course were created using an earlier release of NetSuite. As a result, some record forms and other UI elements presented in the walkthrough demonstrations may be different than what you see in your training account when working through the course exercises. Your student workbook has been updated to account for these differences. The underlying concepts, tasks, and processes presented throughout this course remain unchanged unless otherwise noted.

It is now time for you to complete the required hands-on exercises associated with the topics discussed in this module. To complete the required exercises, refer to your student workbook. When you have finished, you may continue with the next module. This concludes the course introduction module.
